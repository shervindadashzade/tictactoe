# Tic Tac Toe AI
This repository is my first experience with Decision Tree which is used to implement a Tic Tac Toe game Artificial Intelligence. The command-line interface is available to play with the provided AI.

There are two versions of the game, one is compatible with Python version 2, and the other one is compatible with Python version 3.

**No additional library has been used in the development of this AI**

In the following, you can see some screenshots of the application.
